# Helen Greene Blumenschein Obsidian XRF Data
This is a tab-delimited text file (and eventually R data package) containing geochemical data for obsidian artifacts in the Helen Greene Blumenschein Collection, curated at SMU-in-Taos.  These data were generated using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry at Southern Methodist University.

## Description

The data files contain X-ray fluorescence data generated from obsidian artifacts collected from various sites on the Taos Plateau of northern New Mexico.  These data were generated using X-ray fluorescence at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in collaboration with Jeffrey L. Boyer and Mark Henderson.  These data accompany a manuscript that is currently under peer review, and this READ ME will be updated as needed to reflect the status of the review process.

## Installing

This data package can be downloaded directly from GitHub as a tab-delimited text file, or installed remotely through R using the following command:

```
remotes::install_github("mtb-archaeology/hgb.xrf.data")
```
